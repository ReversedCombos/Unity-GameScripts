The "PlayerMovementInput" and "Moisty" scirpts are supposted to go on the root parent of the Player.

The functionality includes Walking, Running, Jumping, Crouching, Sliding, and Looking(FOV-Change included). The tags for the ground and water are "Ground" and
"Water" respectivly.

I've commented most of the code so it should be slightly readable. Everything is controlled by the Update function, which returns a Boolean based off of the
movement. This is used to stop other functions from running while certain functions play. Example -(If the player presses Shift and Ctrl at the same time while 
moving it will slide and the fucntion "SlideCheck()" will return true.)

"PlayerMovementInput" also uses InputActions from unity named "PlayerActions". This will be uploaded later.
