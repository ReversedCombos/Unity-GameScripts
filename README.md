# Unity-GameScripts
This is the repository for scrips I have made for a project game. You are free to use these for your games. I focused on simplicity for most of these, meaning less dependencies.

The folders are organized based off of dependencies. Each script in the folder builds off of or adds functionality to each other. You can edit the code to remove the dependencies based off of what you want. 

Note : I tried to make these script as readable as possible so that other people can add and change it. I would also like feedback for this as to get better at coding.
